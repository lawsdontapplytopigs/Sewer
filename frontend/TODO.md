[ ] have a useless error message easter egg with the stupid "pacman with teeth" emoji
[ ] turn this project into a webapp. if I want to be able to show different windows minimized/maximized, etc based on the link, I need to do it
[ ] make the project use fonts and colors only from the "Palette.elm" module
[ ] make the 'make.sh' script copy all the album art in the './built' dir automatically
[ ] make sure to add a good wallpaper, not the windows xp one
[ ] check out css font rendering options and see if you can make the font look like it's bitmap
