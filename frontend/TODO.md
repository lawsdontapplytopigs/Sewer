[ ] have a useless error message easter egg with the stupid "pacman with teeth" emoji
[ ] turn this project into a webapp. if I want to be able to show different windows minimized/maximized, etc based on the link, I need to do it
[ ] make the project use fonts and colors only from the "Palette.elm" module
[ ] make the 'make.sh' script copy all the album art in the './built' dir automatically
[ ] make sure to add a good wallpaper, not the windows xp one
[ ] check out css font rendering options and see if you can make the font look like it's bitmap
[ ] the current "make.sh", "run.sh" and the backend all use relative paths 
    currently...
    This is obviously not best practice. 
    Should you call "run.sh" in the wrong directory, be ready for unexpected
    results. I'll have to change these to use a well defined, pre-determined 
    directory.
[ ] make it so you can't drag a window's titlebar below the tasklist
